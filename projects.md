Here are a few projects I’m actively working on (or recently wrapped up).

## Bias of Retrospective Reporting to Combat Missingness in Longitudinal Research
**Role:** Lead author • **Status:** Revise & Resubmit (Intl. Journal of Behavioral Development)  
**What:** Simulation study quantifying how retrospective reporting bias distorts growth-curve estimates in longitudinal studies; providing guidance for researchers on when/how bias occurs. 
**Keywords:** *Longitudinal Analysis, Missing Data, Supplemental Sampling*  

## A simulation-based evaluation of incremental recall for accurate network density estimation
**Role:** Co-lead • **Status:** Talk & poster accepted (ISDSA; UVA Research Computing): In-progress
**What:** Simulation study on how **incremental recall** procedures affect network density with participant fatigue; evaluates a new recall method for accurate estimation of network density.  
**Keywords:** *Social Networks, Network Density*

## Periodontitis Trajectories via Tobit Growth Mixture Modeling
**Role:** Lead author • **Status:** Poster accepted (APS): In-progress  
**What:** Analysis of **latent classes** in the progression of dental outcomes.  
**Keywords:** *Censored **Growth Mixture Modeling** (GMM), Longitudinal Analysis*
